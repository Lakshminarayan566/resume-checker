            "2.  **Add a LinkedIn Profile URL:** For a student in tech, a LinkedIn profile is almost a must. It allows recruiters to see your network, endorsements, and potentially more details about your projects. Place it next to your other contact information.\n",

            "4.  **Expand and Organize Technical Skills:**\n",
            "    *   Consider grouping them explicitly (e.g., \"Programming Languages,\" \"Web Technologies,\" \"Databases,\" \"ML Libraries,\" \"Tools\").\n",

            "    *   For \"Algorithm Analysis\" and \"Programming in Java,\" these are broad. If you have specific data structures knowledge (e.g., stacks, queues, trees, graphs) or specific Java frameworks/libraries you've used beyond OOPS, mention them.\n",
            "5.  **Quantify More Where Possible:** While your projects are good at this, look for other areas. For example, if your optimization in the heart disease model led to X% improved accuracy, mention it. (This is harder for general skills but good to keep in mind).\n",
            "6.  **Formatting/Readability (Minor):**\n",
            "    *   Ensure consistent spacing between sections.\n",
            "    *   The \"LANGUAGES\" and \"NPTEL COURSES\" section titles feel a bit small compared to the others. Consistency in heading size for all major sections would be good.\n",
